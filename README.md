# A-Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-and-Prevention
This project implements a machine learning-based system for detecting and preventing credit card fraud. It involves preprocessing transactional data, handling class imbalance, and training classification models such as Logistic Regression and Random Forest. Model performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score.
1. Define the Objective
My principal goal is to detect fraudulent transactions using data and machine learning.
Problem type: Binary classification (fraud = 1, non-fraud = 0)
Objective: Build a model that predicts if a given transaction is fraudulent.

#2. Get the Dataset
A commonly used dataset is from Kaggle:
Dataset name: Credit Card Fraud Detection
Description: European credit card transactions in September 2013
284,807 transactions 492 are fraudulent (highly imbalanced data!)
   
Features are numerical (V1–V28 from PCA transformation) + “Amount” + “Time”

#3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Understand the data before modeling.
Tasks:
Load dataset (pandas)
Check shape, columns, datatypes
Count fraud vs. non-fraud (value_counts)
Visualize class imbalance with bar chart
Plot transaction amount distributions
Use correlation heatmaps to find relationships
Example:
import pandas as pdimport matplotlib.pyplot as pltimport seaborn as sns

data = pd.read_csv('creditcard.csv')
print(data.info())print(data['Class'].value_counts())

sns.countplot(x='Class', data=data)
plt.title('Fraud vs Non-Fraud Transactions')
plt.show()

#4. Data Preprocessing
Since the data is already cleaned and PCA-transformed, only minimal preprocessing is needed.
Steps:
Scale the Amount and Time columns using StandardScaler
Handle class imbalance (use undersampling, oversampling, or SMOTE)
Split the data into training and testing sets
Example:
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_splitfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScalerfrom imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE

scaler = StandardScaler()
data['Amount'] = scaler.fit_transform(data[['Amount']])
data['Time'] = scaler.fit_transform(data[['Time']])

X = data.drop('Class', axis=1)
y = data['Class']
# Handle imbalance
sm = SMOTE(random_state=42)
X_res, y_res = sm.fit_resample(X, y)
# Train-test split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_res, y_res, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

#5. Model Training
You can start with simple models, then move to more advanced ones.
Popular algorithms:
Logistic Regression (baseline)
Random Forest
XGBoost / LightGBM
Neural Network (optional for advanced users)
Example:
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

#6. Model Evaluation
Because the data is imbalanced, accuracy alone is not enough.
Use:
Precision, Recall, F1-score
Confusion Matrix
ROC-AUC Curve
Example:
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix, roc_auc_score, roc_curveimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt

y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
sns.heatmap(confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred), annot=True, fmt='d')
plt.title('Confusion Matrix')
plt.show()

#7. Fraud Prevention Strategies (Beyond ML)
Detection is only one side — prevention involves:
Real-time monitoring (e.g., anomaly detection with streaming data)
Rules-based systems (e.g., flag transactions above certain limits)
User verification (e.g., 2FA)
Behavioral analysis (e.g., spending pattern deviation)
#8. Model Deployment (Optional but Impressive)
You can deploy your model using:
Flask or FastAPI for backend API
Streamlit or Gradio for an interactive dashboard
Cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure) for scalability

#9. Present Your Results
Include:
Problem overview
Dataset summary
Visualizations
Model results (metrics & plots)
Insights on fraud prevention

 # Bonus: Fraud Prevention Strategy
1. High-level approach (single sentence)

Combine a low-latency rule layer + online feature store + fast machine-learning scorer (ensemble of supervised model(s) + anomaly detector + graph signals) + human-in-the-loop case handling, with continuous feedback from confirmed labels (chargebacks/disputes) to retrain and tune models.

2. Architecture & components (real-time pipeline)

Event ingestion: transactions stream into Kafka (or similar) as they happen.

Feature enrichment (streaming): call or join to a Feature Store (Feast / custom) to fetch precomputed historical features and append lightweight online features computed on the fly (rolling counts, deltas). Also enrich with external lookups (BIN, geo IP).

Rule engine (first pass): deterministic business rules that can instantly block/soft-decline or route to verification (e.g., amount > X for high-risk merchant, stolen-card flag). Rules reduce obvious fraud and control false positives.

Real-time model scoring: a low-latency model server (TF-Serving / TorchServe / ONNX / Treelite for tree models) that returns a fraud probability in <50–200 ms. Use an ensemble:

fast gradient-boosted tree (LightGBM, CatBoost) for main supervised score

anomaly detector (e.g., Isolation Forest, streaming LOF, or autoencoder) for novel patterns

graph-based risk (entity link analysis / GNN offline or precomputed risk score) for rings and collusion

Decisioning layer: combine rule decisions + model score + business thresholds to produce one of: approve, challenge (2FA/OTP), hold for review, decline, or escalate to investigation queue. Score explanations (SHAP/TreeSHAP approximations) provided for investigators.

Orchestration / workflow: Case management system for human investigators; automated retries, notifications, and appeal handling.

Feedback loop and labeling: ingest outcomes (chargeback, confirmed fraud, customer dispute) to label the transaction and feed it to the training data.

Monitoring & A/B: live metrics, model drift detection, champion/challenger experiments, alerting.

3. Features to engineer from your dataset (using V1–V28, Time, Amount)

Assuming V1–V28 are anonymized PCA-like features (as in common credit-card datasets) plus Time and Amount, you should:

Direct & transformed features

log_amount = log(1 + Amount)

time_of_day, day_of_week derived from Time

zscore_amount relative to user mean/median

Aggregates / velocity (computed via feature store / streaming)

txn_count_1h, txn_count_24h

sum_amount_24h, avg_amount_7d

max_amount_30d

unique_merchant_count_7d

time_since_last_txn, time_between_last_2_txns

Behavioral / deviation features

amount_deviation = Amount / avg_amount_30d

location_mismatch_flag (transaction country != last known country)

device_change_flag (new device id)

auth_failure_count_24h

Features from the anonymized PCA columns

interactions between principal components (V7*V14, etc.) and log_amount or time-of-day — tree models can capture these but include some explicit interactions if you suspect them.

Anomaly & sequence features

sliding-window sequence embedding (e.g., last 10 txn amounts/time deltas) for an LSTM or transformer-based sequence model (useful but heavier).

4. Additional data points & external sources to integrate (priority order)

These materially improve accuracy:

High priority

BIN / Issuer metadata: bank identification number (issuer country, bank type, issuer risk score).

IP geolocation & ISP (MaxMind / IP2Location): country, distance from cardholder’s billing address, anonymity/VPN detection.

Device fingerprinting: device ID, browser fingerprint, OS, app version — to detect new devices or device churn.

Velocity / behavior history: account-level, card-level rolling aggregates (1h/24h/7d).

Chargeback & dispute history: merchant and cardholder histories.

Email / phone reputation: validation, age of email, phone carrier, whether associated with fraud lists.

Merchant risk score: historical chargeback rate, industry risk bucket.

Medium priority

Card holder KYC signals: account age, verification status, and last verification date.

3DS / SCA result: whether strong authentication succeeded or failed.

Fraud blacklists: shared lists of compromised cards, devices, or IPs.

Threat intel feeds: lists of known fraudulent merchants, malware IPs, Tor/VPN nodes.

Advanced / long-term

Graph / network data: links between card numbers, devices, IPs, phone numbers, emails to detect rings. Build entity graph and compute connected components / PageRank-like risk scores.

Tokenization & EMV cryptogram data: deeper card-present signals.

External financial data: merchant acquirer risk, bank-level fraud patterns.

User behavioral biometrics (typing speed, swipe patterns) — privacy sensitive but useful if available.

5. Models & techniques (which to use and why)

Gradient-boosted trees (LightGBM / XGBoost / CatBoost) — primary supervised model: excellent accuracy, fast inference when compiled (Treelite, ONNX).

Logistic regression — fast baseline for interpretability and calibration.

Online / incremental learners (Vowpal Wabbit, river) — to adapt quickly to new patterns in streaming data.

Anomaly detection (Isolation Forest, streaming clustering, autoencoders) — catch novel attacks that weren’t in training labels.

Graph models / GNNs — detect collusion rings (use offline to score entities and precompute risk for real time).

Sequence models (LSTM/transformer) — detect unusual sequences of behavior for an account (optional; heavier).

Handling imbalance

Use cost-sensitive learning, class weighting, focal loss, or sample-level strategies (SMOTE for offline training only) — but avoid oversampling in production; prefer calibrated probabilities and cost-aware thresholds.

6. Decisioning & risk controls

Multi-action policy: don’t only block — use graded actions: approve, soft challenge (OTP), hard challenge, hold, or decline. Soft challenges reduce false positives.

Dynamic thresholds: adjust thresholds by merchant risk tier, time-of-day, and business cost function (tradeoff between false positives and fraud losses).

Score calibration: ensure model probabilities are well-calibrated (Platt scaling, isotonic).

Explainability: provide short, interpretable reasons with every high-risk decision for investigators and to produce automated response text for customer service.

7. Evaluation & metrics (what to monitor)

Model metrics (on holdout): Precision @ k, Recall, F1, ROC-AUC, PR-AUC. For skewed data prioritize Precision-Recall and cost-weighted metrics.

Business metrics: Fraud loss prevented ($), false positive rate (FRR), false decline rate (customer friction), chargeback rate, investigation throughput.

Operational metrics: latency (<200 ms ideally), CPU/memory costs, model uptime.

Drift detection: feature distribution drift, sudden rise in anomaly detector alerts, decrease in model R² or PR-AUC.

8. Human-in-the-loop & operations

Investigator UI: show transaction, top contributing features (SHAP), entity history, graph links, and suggested action.

Prioritization: route high-probability and high-value transactions to investigators first.

Label capture: record investigator outcomes and chargeback results to update training set with true labels and timestamps.

Retraining cadence: schedule daily or weekly retrain depending on drift rate; use incremental learners to adapt between retrains.

9. Privacy, compliance & security

PCI-DSS compliance for card data (tokenize PAN, encrypt in transit & rest).

GDPR / local privacy laws: minimize PII, store only needed signals, ensure right to erasure processes.

Data retention policies: keep historical training data but obey legal limits.

Access controls & audit trails: for model versions and decision logs.

10. Quick implementation roadmap (practical phased plan)

Phase 0 (quick wins, 2–4 weeks)

Implement deterministic rules (high amount, known blacklists).

Build streaming ingestion + simple feature store for last-24h aggregates.

Train LightGBM on your dataset with engineered aggregates; serve via a lightweight server.

Add callouts to external BIN + IP geo.

Phase 1 (3 months)

Full feature store and online feature computation (rolling windows).

Deploy model ensemble (tree + anomaly).

Investigator UI + feedback capture.

Basic monitoring & A/B testing.

Phase 2 (3–6 months)

Graph analytics for entity linking; precompute entity risk to use at scoring.

Online incremental learning to adapt quickly.

Fine-tune decision logic with cost-sensitive thresholds and dynamic rules.

Phase 3 (6–12 months)

Add advanced signals (device fingerprinting, 3DS integration, biometrics if available).

GNN models for collusion detection and deeper automation.

Continuous improvement loop and full automation where safe.

12. Final notes / tradeoffs

False positives are often more costly (customer churn) than letting a small percent of fraud slip through; tune thresholds around business costs, not just accuracy.

Latency vs richness: every external lookup adds latency. Precompute and cache expensive enrichments; prefer precomputed features in feature store for real-time scoring.

Explainability: keep at least one interpretable model or approximations for compliance and operations.
