# A-Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-and-Prevention

üìç Introduction

What is this project?
This project implements a machine learning-based system for detecting and preventing credit card fraud. It involves preprocessing transactional data, handling class imbalance, and training classification models such as Logistic Regression and Random Forest. Model performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score.

üìç Define the Objective

My principal goal is to detect fraudulent transactions using data and machine learning.
Problem type: Binary classification (fraud = 1, non-fraud = 0)
Objective: Build a model that predicts if a given transaction is fraudulent.

#2. Get the Dataset

A commonly used dataset is from Kaggle:
Dataset name: Credit Card Fraud Detection
Description: European credit card transactions in September 2013
284,807 transactions 492 are fraudulent (highly imbalanced data!)
Features are numerical (V1‚ÄìV28 from PCA transformation) + ‚ÄúAmount‚Äù + ‚ÄúTime‚Äù

#3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Understand the data before modeling.
Tasks:
Load dataset (pandas)
Check shape, columns, datatypes
Count fraud vs. non-fraud (value_counts)
Visualize class imbalance with bar chart
Plot transaction amount distributions
Use correlation heatmaps to find relationships
Example:
import pandas as pdimport matplotlib.pyplot as pltimport seaborn as sns

data = pd.read_csv('creditcard.csv')
print(data.info())print(data['Class'].value_counts())

sns.countplot(x='Class', data=data)
plt.title('Fraud vs Non-Fraud Transactions')
plt.show()

#4. Data Preprocessing
Since the data is already cleaned and PCA-transformed, only minimal preprocessing is needed.
Steps:
Scale the Amount and Time columns using StandardScaler
Handle class imbalance (use undersampling, oversampling, or SMOTE)
Split the data into training and testing sets
Example:
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_splitfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScalerfrom imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE

scaler = StandardScaler()
data['Amount'] = scaler.fit_transform(data[['Amount']])
data['Time'] = scaler.fit_transform(data[['Time']])

X = data.drop('Class', axis=1)
y = data['Class']
#5. Model Training
We can start with simple models, then move to more advanced ones.
Popular algorithms:

#6. Model Evaluation
Because the data is imbalanced, accuracy alone is not enough.
Use:
Precision, Recall, F1-score
Confusion Matrix
ROC-AUC Curve

#7. Fraud Prevention Strategies (Beyond ML)

Detection is only one side ‚Äî prevention involves:
Real-time monitoring (e.g., anomaly detection with streaming data)
Rules-based systems (e.g., flag transactions above certain limits)
User verification (e.g., 2FA)
Behavioral analysis (e.g., spending pattern deviation)
#8. Model Deployment (Optional but Impressive)
You can deploy your model using:
Flask or FastAPI for backend API
Streamlit or Gradio for an interactive dashboard
Cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure) for scalability

#9. Present Your Results

Include:
Problem overview
Dataset summary
Visualizations
Model results (metrics & plots)
Insights on fraud prevention

1. High-level approach (single sentence)

Combine a low-latency rule layer + online feature store + fast machine-learning scorer (ensemble of supervised model(s) + anomaly detector + graph signals) + human-in-the-loop case handling, with continuous feedback from confirmed labels (chargebacks/disputes) to retrain and tune models.

2.  components (real-time pipeline)

Event ingestion: transactions stream into Kafka (or similar) as they happen.
Feature enrichment (streaming): call or join to a Feature Store (Feast / custom) to fetch precomputed historical features and append lightweight online features computed on the fly (rolling counts, deltas). Also enrich with external lookups (BIN, geo IP).

Rule engine (first pass): deterministic business rules that can instantly block/soft-decline or route to verification (e.g., amount > X for high-risk merchant, stolen-card flag). Rules reduce obvious fraud and control false positives.
3. Features to engineer from your dataset (using V1‚ÄìV28, Time, Amount)
Assuming V1‚ÄìV28 are anonymized PCA-like features (as in common credit-card datasets) plus Time and Amount, you should:
Direct & transformed features
log_amount = log(1 + Amount)
time_of_day, day_of_week derived from Time
zscore_amount relative to user mean/median
Aggregates / velocity (computed via feature store / streaming)
txn_count_1h, txn_count_24h
sum_amount_24h, avg_amount_7d
max_amount_30d
unique_merchant_count_7d
time_since_last_txn, time_between_last_2_txns
Behavioral / deviation features
amount_deviation = Amount / avg_amount_30d
location_mismatch_flag (transaction country != last known country)
device_change_flag (new device id)
auth_failure_count_24h
Features from the anonymized PCA columns
interactions between principal components (V7*V14, etc.) and log_amount or time-of-day ‚Äî tree models can capture these but include some explicit interactions if you suspect them.
Anomaly & sequence features
sliding-window sequence embedding (e.g., last 10 txn amounts/time deltas) for an LSTM or transformer-based sequence model (useful but heavier).

4. Additional data points & external sources to integrate (priority order)

These materially improve accuracy:
High priority
BIN / Issuer metadata: bank identification number (issuer country, bank type, issuer risk score).
IP geolocation & ISP (MaxMind / IP2Location): country, distance from cardholder‚Äôs billing address, anonymity/VPN detection.
Device fingerprinting: device ID, browser fingerprint, OS, app version ‚Äî to detect new devices or device churn.
Velocity / behavior history: account-level, card-level rolling aggregates (1h/24h/7d).
Chargeback & dispute history: merchant and cardholder histories.
Email / phone reputation: validation, age of email, phone carrier, whether associated with fraud lists.
Merchant risk score: historical chargeback rate, industry risk bucket.
Card holder KYC signals: account age, verification status, and last verification date.
3DS / SCA result: whether strong authentication succeeded or failed.
Fraud blacklists: shared lists of compromised cards, devices, or IPs.
Threat intel feeds: lists of known fraudulent merchants, malware IPs, Tor/VPN nodes.
Advanced / long-term
Graph / network data: links between card numbers, devices, IPs, phone numbers, emails to detect rings. Build entity graph and compute connected components / PageRank-like risk scores.
Tokenization & EMV cryptogram data: deeper card-present signals.
External financial data: merchant acquirer risk, bank-level fraud patterns.
User behavioral biometrics (typing speed, swipe patterns) ‚Äî privacy sensitive but useful if available.

5. Decisioning & risk controls

Multi-action policy: don‚Äôt only block ‚Äî use graded actions: approve, soft challenge (OTP), hard challenge, hold, or decline. Soft challenges reduce false positives.
Dynamic thresholds: adjust thresholds by merchant risk tier, time-of-day, and business cost function (tradeoff between false positives and fraud losses).
Score calibration: ensure model probabilities are well-calibrated (Platt scaling, isotonic).
Explainability: provide short, interpretable reasons with every high-risk decision for investigators and to produce automated response text for customer service.
