# A-Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-and-Prevention
This project implements a machine learning-based system for detecting and preventing credit card fraud. It involves preprocessing transactional data, handling class imbalance, and training classification models such as Logistic Regression and Random Forest. Model performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score.
1. Define the Objective
My principal goal is to detect fraudulent transactions using data and machine learning.
Problem type: Binary classification (fraud = 1, non-fraud = 0)
Objective: Build a model that predicts if a given transaction is fraudulent.

2. Get the Dataset
A commonly used dataset is from Kaggle:
Dataset name: Credit Card Fraud Detection
Description: European credit card transactions in September 2013
284,807 transactions 492 are fraudulent (highly imbalanced data!)
   
Features are numerical (V1–V28 from PCA transformation) + “Amount” + “Time”

4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Understand the data before modeling.
Tasks:
Load dataset (pandas)
Check shape, columns, datatypes
Count fraud vs. non-fraud (value_counts)
Visualize class imbalance with bar chart
Plot transaction amount distributions
Use correlation heatmaps to find relationships
Example:
import pandas as pdimport matplotlib.pyplot as pltimport seaborn as sns

data = pd.read_csv('creditcard.csv')
print(data.info())print(data['Class'].value_counts())

sns.countplot(x='Class', data=data)
plt.title('Fraud vs Non-Fraud Transactions')
plt.show()

4. Data Preprocessing
Since the data is already cleaned and PCA-transformed, only minimal preprocessing is needed.
Steps:
Scale the Amount and Time columns using StandardScaler
Handle class imbalance (use undersampling, oversampling, or SMOTE)
Split the data into training and testing sets
Example:
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_splitfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScalerfrom imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE

scaler = StandardScaler()
data['Amount'] = scaler.fit_transform(data[['Amount']])
data['Time'] = scaler.fit_transform(data[['Time']])

X = data.drop('Class', axis=1)
y = data['Class']
# Handle imbalance
sm = SMOTE(random_state=42)
X_res, y_res = sm.fit_resample(X, y)
# Train-test split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_res, y_res, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

5. Model Training
You can start with simple models, then move to more advanced ones.
Popular algorithms:
Logistic Regression (baseline)
Random Forest
XGBoost / LightGBM
Neural Network (optional for advanced users)
Example:
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

6. Model Evaluation
Because the data is imbalanced, accuracy alone is not enough.
Use:
Precision, Recall, F1-score
Confusion Matrix
ROC-AUC Curve
Example:
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix, roc_auc_score, roc_curveimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt

y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
sns.heatmap(confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred), annot=True, fmt='d')
plt.title('Confusion Matrix')
plt.show()

7. Fraud Prevention Strategies (Beyond ML)
Detection is only one side — prevention involves:
Real-time monitoring (e.g., anomaly detection with streaming data)
Rules-based systems (e.g., flag transactions above certain limits)
User verification (e.g., 2FA)
Behavioral analysis (e.g., spending pattern deviation)
8. Model Deployment (Optional but Impressive)
You can deploy your model using:
Flask or FastAPI for backend API
Streamlit or Gradio for an interactive dashboard
Cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure) for scalability

9. Present Your Results
Include:
Problem overview
Dataset summary
Visualizations
Model results (metrics & plots)
Insights on fraud prevention
